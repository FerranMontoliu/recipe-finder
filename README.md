## üì¶ How to set up and run Recipe finder

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash  
    git clone https://github.com/FerranMontoliu/recipe-finder.git  
    cd recipe-finder  
    ```
2. Install `pnpm`
    ```bash  
    npm install -g pnpm 
    ```
3. Install the dependencies
    ```bash  
    pnpm i 
    ```
4. Run the application locally

## üí° Assumptions and design decisions
-   **Type safety**: `TypeScript` is used throughout the project to catch errors at compile time and reduce the likelihood of runtime failures. To further strengthen data integrity, all external data is decoded using `schemawax`, ensuring it follows the expected schema before it is used in the application.

-   **UI**: The UI is built with the `Mantine` component library, selected for its modern, customizable design system.

-   **Performance optimization**: A client-side caching layer has been implemented using `React Query`, minimizing redundant API calls and improving perceived application speed and responsiveness, while ensuring that the rate limits are not exceeded.

-   **Testing strategy**: The application includes both integration and end-to-end (E2E) tests. Integration tests (via `Vitest`) cover functionality like interactions with `localStorage`, while E2E tests (via `Playwright`) validate full user flows across both desktop and mobile viewports.

-   **Code quality & consistency**: Code standards are enforced using `ESLint`, `Prettier`, and `Husky`. These tools ensure clean, consistent code and help prevent common errors by running automated checks during development and before each commit.
